# PSB-IP-ML-Showcase
Sample group project submission from PSB Academy's Introduction to Programming (IP) Machine Learning project in Trimester 3, 2019.

Showcased in PSB Academy School of Engineering and Technology (SET) Monthly E-Neswletter, Jan 2020 Edition.

### Project Details
Data of students studying in PSB Academy were collected through an internal survey, where different groups of the Introduction to Programming module had to create a supervised machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem (groups were allowed to choose any topic of their choice, as long as it used the provided dataset). 

## Getting Started
The IP-ML-Sample.ipynb file contains the main code with descriptions of the steps taken, as well as some explanations and recommended links for additional reading, targeted towards readers of the PSB SET E-Newsletter. 

It is recommended to install Ananconda (Python 3.7 version).
Alternatively, the .ipynb file can also be run in Google Colab.

An installation guide (.pdf) to run .ipynb files with Jupyter Notebook (after installing Anaconda) is available. 
Anaconda_Installation_and_Usage_Guide.pdf was originally shared during one of the PSB SCS SC AI Focus Group Sessions(Python Crash Course #1, 17th January 2020).

## Dependencies & Requirements
Python 3.7 and the following packages were used:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Dataset
psb_survey.csv contains the result of a survey conducted amongst 229 students studying in PSB Academy. 
The anonymous survey required students to answer a series compulsory questions (multiple choice/ open-ended). 
The survey was created by William Gunawan of Coventry University (CU), and the students of PSB Academy FT DICT 119,219 worked together to survey other students to collect results.
